# DevOps the Hard Way on Azure

Welcome to the DevOps the Hard Way on Azure tutorial! üöÄ

This comprehensive guide provides a real-world solution for implementing DevOps practices and technologies to deploy applications and cloud services/infrastructure on Microsoft Azure.

## üåü What's Inside?

- Free labs
- Detailed documentation
- Step-by-step guides

All designed to help you set up a complete DevOps environment from a real-world perspective in Azure.

## üé≠ The DevOps Scenario

Imagine this: You've just joined a company stuck in the past. They're drowning in:
- [ ] Bare metal servers
- [ ] Manual deployments
- [ ] Outdated IT practices

> **Your mission, should you choose to accept it:**  
> Modernise everything. Make the organisation not just succeed, but lead the pack.

## üí° The DevOps Solution

We're going to deploy the thomasthornton.cloud application, transforming it from a bare-metal application to a DevOps masterpiece.

> üîç **Note**: As a DevOps/Platform Engineer, your focus is on deployment, not application development. That's why we're using an existing app for this tutorial.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

Get ready to utilise a range of cutting-edge technologies and platforms to establish your DevOps environment:

| Technology | Purpose |
|------------|---------|
| Azure | Cloud hosting and services |
| GitHub | Code repository |
| Python | Application and automation |
| Terraform | Infrastructure as Code |
| Docker | Containerisation |
| Kubernetes (AKS) | Container orchestration |
| GitHub Actions | CI/CD |
| Checkov | Automated testing |
| Terraform-docs | Documentation automation |

## üß™ Labs

[ ] Check boxes have been added to each lab to help you keep track of your progress.
